I'll give you a quick rundown of the kind of obstacles we've all faced:

1. Setting Goals
- Developers need to have well-defined and specific goals based on the vision behind the web application. Knowing how websites and apps add value to your users can help you get your project on track. Once the goals are set, make sure that developers and team (everyone) are involved in the business and on the same page to discuss the goals with the team, if it makes sense to do so.

2. Designing
- Creating an attractive design is important, but it’s not easy. It requires creativity and a detailed understanding of UI / UX design, programming languages, and developer skills.

3. Speed and Performance
- The load time should not exceed 3 seconds. Otherwise, users may lose interest and leave the site. Improving the speed and performance of your website or application is one of the biggest challenges for developers.

4. Working Frame
- There are some frameworks, programming languages, and equipment to be had withinside the net improvement industry, for constructing net apps. Selecting the proper form of equipment and frameworks can sound easy, however, this is an undertaking many builders fail to apprehend withinside the early ranges of improvement.

5. Safety and Security
- There are many ways to improve the security of your website or app. Make sure your web developer is considering all possible security measures during the development process.</p>

<b>How long have you been a wordpress developer</b>

<p>As I told in the cover letter that I'm in this field for the past 15 years. Including 8+ years of experience in Wordpress</p>



<b>Describe recent your experience in completing a project similar to this one.</b>

<p>I’ve worked on similar web development projects before. Our goal was to Make it user-friendly, Responsive to every device & Should load quickly, and my primary role was Project Management. I cooperated with four other people in the team, and believe the structure of work and the agile project management we applied. Anyway, I understand the biggest threats of similar projects and the level of commitment one needs to have to complete them within the given time frame. I believe to be ready to do so and cannot wait to work on similar projects in your company.</p>


<p>I have no experience and I honestly think it is better for you. Just think about it for a moment. You have excellent processes in place for everything, you know how to achieve desired results. Employee like me is like a clean sheet, unspoiled by experience from previous jobs. I am not going to try to do things my way, or to reinvent the wheel. On the contrary, I am ready to listen and learn and eventually do things your way, the one you know works, and brings the desired results. Isn’t that better than hiring somebody experienced who would argue with the managers, and disagree with everything every day? The decision is yours…</p>


<p>I think my portfolio does this job better than I do. Just have a look at this and this project [you show them your portfolio, either online or in print]. As you can see, I’ve worked on similar applications and projects to what you do in your company. I led the entire team, and was responsible for delivering the project on time, and meeting every objective we had. As you can see on [this and this example], we worked on [this and this thing] and reached [this and that result]. Do you have any questions about the projects, or do you want me to elaborate on my role any further?</p>



<b>What’s the best project you’ve ever worked on?</b>


<p>My response may surprise you: my failed mobile app development project is the best one I've ever worked on. The reason is simple: working on this project taught me so much. I made many mistakes, underestimated market research, and at the time I was a project manager with two node developers and one react developer but didn't hire a good tester early enough, so we eventually released a site that was deemed to crash in some cases. But it was a great experience. When you fail, you learn the most, and I believe this project helped me become a better product manager.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there’s nothing like best or worst project. Sometimes you succeed to reach your goals, and other times you fail. At the end of the day, the final outcome is never entirely in your hands. Market trends, moves of your competitors, work of other team members–it all has an impact on each project. Instead of considering projects successes or failures, I simply consider each one a learning experience. I try my best in work, but I do not well much on either successes or failures. Each project I worked on was great, because it helped me to become better in what I do, to move forward. And I always tried my best. Whether it eventually panned out in the way we wanted is of secondary importance to me…</p>



<b>What time you usually work?</b>

<p>I usually work on 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. IST, Sometimes I can manage to work at other time if a client request to do so.
And I'm pleased to tell you I can work from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Germany time (GMT+2)</p>



<b>What do you think is important when it comes to websites?</b>

<p>When it comes to website creation, the most essential to keep in mind is to make it SEO-optimized and user-friendly.
Furthermore, it should be appealing with a good color scheme so that users like using your site, and there should be an easy call to action to achieve our goals.</p>



<b>Please confirm you understand we are looking for a gold standard of design that is NOT based on existing templates.</b>

<p>I understand that you require a core designer rather than a designer who customizes pre-existing design templates.
I can conduct a paid test to demonstrate my abilities solely for you. I've been designing websites for over ten years and counting.
<p/>



<b>PM, how do you manage a business in 3 different industries - Technology, Marketing, and Finance?</b>

<p>I manage experts and the experts manage that particular business.</p>



<b>Could you share a link to some design system components you built in the past?</b>

<p>Sure! here are the link to most design work I've done recently using Components
(Figma links)</p> 



<b>Have you worked in the past with Figma?</b>

<p>Yes!
At now I'm using only Figma for my UI/UX design.

Here are some links as others are NDA protected.
(Figma links not more then 3)</p>

<p>Yes!
As I said, I have worked using JQuery for 5+ years & counting.
jQuery functions like
.toggleClass()
.hide()
.show()
.animate()
.slideDown()</p>



<b>If you have 2 services e.g. service 1 & service 2, both doing same actions, but only different endpoint. How can you prevent duplicate code?</b>

<p>In order to avoid code duplication, we are going to design a specific layer dedicated to the handling of external requests where we can place the definitions of all the needed API requests. This layer aims to divide where API requests are defined from where they are used to make calls. </p>



<b>How do you ensure good code quality? Name few points</b>

<p>The following points will help me ensure high-quality code on the front end.

- by comments
- by API call should be in one file
- by Creating functions for API Call

For general programming, I keep this in my mind.
- Naming conventions.
- Spaces optimization.
- Architectural patterns.
- Add helpful comments</p>



<b>Include a link to a project source code or piece of code you made and see as good code quality. C#, Java and TypeScript allowed</b>

<p>At this point of discussion, I can't share my git Code to show you my coding skills as it is NDA Protected.
We can share it at the time of project commencement.
moreover, I'm ready to give a paid test to show you my skills.</p>



<b>How can you be confident to put your code in production? What helps with feeling safe to deploy and run your code?</b>

<p>We prioritize testing sufficiently. So, first and foremost, we push code to the development server. If everything works properly, proceed to production after testing and client approval.</p>
